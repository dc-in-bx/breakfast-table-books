<h1>Off to a good start.</h1>
<h2>Creating a GitHub Pages site.</h2>
<h3>Creating my first page</h3>
<p>I set up this site by following the guidance on the following page: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">Creating a GitHub Pages site</a></p>
<p>It seems that my default 'home' page is the README.md file in my repository. I'm not sure if this is correct - I assumed that the README would be used to provide some details about the project, and that I could create a separate page that woudl act as the 'proper' home page. I will look into this. </p>
<h3>Setting up a theme</h3>
<p>I wanted to make my first page look more like a website, so I referred to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll">Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to what the above guidance says, I <i>didn't</i> already have a '''_config.yml' file in my repository, so I had to manually create one.</p>
