# Food for the eyes...
<p>On my little breakfast table, nestled between a sleepy vinyl cutter and cosy book nook, are <strong>five books</strong>.</p>
<p>They are the start of an optimistic design library that will (hopefully) inspire me to pursue creative endeavours. I placed them on my breakfast table hoping that I would read them each morning. I haven't made that leap <i>just</i> yet but who knows; using them as the subject of this GitHub Pages site might finally give me the push I need to dig in.</p>
<p>I'll share some details about each book on this site. Check them out if you're interested!</p>
