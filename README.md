<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>On my little breakfast table, nestled between a cosy book nook and a sleepy vinyl cutter, are <strong>five books</strong>.</p>
<img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dc-in-bx/breakfast-table-books/refs/heads/main/images/breakfast-table.jpg" alt="My breakfast table">
<p>I placed them on my breakfast table hoping that I would read them each morning.</p>
<p> I haven't made the leap <i>just</i> yet but who knows; using them as the subject of this <i>GitHub Pages</i> site might finally give me the push I need to dig in.</p>
<p>I'll share some details about each book on this site. <strong>Check them out if you're interested!</strong></p>
